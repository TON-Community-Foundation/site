            <p class="paragraph">TON Сommunity Foundation (TСF) is a non-profit association of TON ecosystem participants: developers, validator-node and/or pool owners and members, investors, companies, founders and employees of all types of TON-based projects. The principles of decentralization that underlie any community require significant, coherent efforts to implement and support them. Our main mission is to enable the fastest and the most effective development of TON as a decentralized system through collaboration and cooperation.<br /></p>
            <h3 class="heading">Nonprofit principle</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">TON Community Foundation is a non-profit organization.

            <h3 class="heading">Transparency</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">TCF shall conduct its business in full transparency and will record all its decisions, proposals, votes, fund distribution and meeting records on TON permanent ledger using TON smart contracts. The Observer Pool will play a specific role to maintain transparency by participating in forums, meetings, and in decision processes as observers.<br /></p>
            <h3 class="heading">Legal Process</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">TCF will commence upon the signing of a declaration by Key Members. At a later stage TCF members will be able to vote for the establishment of a legal entity in a proper jurisdiction.<br /></p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong> Key member</strong><br />Key participants are community representatives who, in the community&#x27;s eyes, are key to ecosystem development. At the start this member group will be represented by TCF founders, later it will be expanded to the maximum of 150. To get into this tier one has to replace a sitting key member, so this is not a permanent, albeit a long-term membership. Only key members can veto decisions of the Governing Council.<br /><br /></p>
